      Hi! Here I decided to tell a little about myself, share my thoughts, ideas
      and tell about my life as an expat in Europe. I moved to Finland in 2014
      when I was 17 to study at university. My student life was incredible, I
      got to meet so many people from all over the world and share my adventures
      with them....
